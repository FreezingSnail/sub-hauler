# Platform — sub-hauler

Canonical hardware, resource, and toolchain context for this project.
`README.md` and `AGENTS.md` point here; task prompts should link here too.
Keep dated measurements in the checkpoint table instead of copying them around.

## Target

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Board | Arduboy FX (`arduboy-homemade:avr:arduboy-fx`) |
| MCU | ATmega32u4 |
| Display | 128×64 SSD1306 OLED, native 1-bit |
| Framebuffer | 1,024 B (`Arduboy2Base::sBuffer`) |
| Cart | external FX flash; one packed `fxdata/fxdata.bin` |
| Display mode | native 1-bit via `Arduboy2Base` |
| Logical frame | `FRAME(x)` = `x`; one image per frame |
| Blitting | `Blit::draw` plus-mask blits into `sBuffer`; no OLED access |
| Presentation | one `FX::display(CLEAR_BUFFER)` after update/render |
| Frame rate | 60 fps (`arduboy.setFrameRate(60)`) |
| Toolchain | arduino-cli 1.2.0; arduboy-homemade:avr 1.4.0; AVR-GCC 7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7; `-mrelax -mcall-prologues`; LTO |
| Math | integer/fixed-point only; no `float`/`double` |

## Resource budgets

| Resource | Limit | Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Program flash | 29,696 B | `.text` + `.data` from `make size` |
| SRAM | 2,560 B | `.data` + `.bss` static; the remainder is stack/locals |
| Stack | explicit reserve | static free bytes alone do not prove stack fit |

The Makefile enforces the flash limit and reports both totals with `make size`.
LTO makes per-symbol size arithmetic misleading; only whole-image A/B
measurements count. There is no separate project ceiling yet; add one here
with a date if the project adopts one.

## SPI / display contract

- The OLED and FX cart share SPI.
- Cart reads happen in update/render, never during an OLED transaction.
- Normal presents once per frame with `FX::display(CLEAR_BUFFER)` after
  rendering; that call is the display transaction.
- `FX::begin(FX_DATA_PAGE)` opens the cart image. Use `FX_SAVE_PAGE` when a save
  partition is added.

## Measurement checkpoints

Dated whole-image numbers are evidence, not guaranteed headroom.

| Date | Flash | Static RAM | Toolchain / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-20 | 6,636 B | 1,214 B | arduino-cli 1.2.0; arduboy-homemade:avr 1.4.0; AVR-GCC 7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7; `make size` |

Static free SRAM is 1,346 B. No painted stack checkpoint yet; static free bytes
alone do not prove stack fit. Re-measure after art or logic changes.
